#Calculator

Using math.js and MathJax, this calculator can do the equivalent of about nothing. 
First time making a serious (ok maybe not) attempt at trying to develop a front-end based website.
Maybe not the best quality, but whatever.
Added project log as required and css bunny from the interwebs.
